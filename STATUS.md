  - [x] Worker: 4.66 GB (Python 3.12 + ML dependencies + OCR)
- [x] Push repository to GitHub (https://github.com/molotovsingh/legal_events_prod.git)
- [ ] **BLOCKED:** Start Docker containers (insufficient disk space)
- [ ] Verify all services start successfully
  - [ ] PostgreSQL

  - [ ] amrapali_case/Amrapali Allotment Letter.pdf
- [ ] Verify extraction quality vs POC
- [ ] Test all providers
  - [ ] OpenRouter
  - [ ] Anthropic
  - [ ] OpenAI
  - [ ] LangExtract (Gemini)
- [ ] Test export functionality
  - [ ] CSV export
  - [ ] XLSX export
  - [ ] JSON export
- [ ] Document all bugs found in GitHub Issues
- [x] Update this STATUS.md with findings

**Current Status:** BLOCKED - See "Critical Blocker" section below

**Expected Completion:** Pending resolution of disk space issue

---

### 📋 Phase 3: Iterative Fixes (NOT STARTED)

**Goal:** Fix discovered bugs one by one

**Process:**
- Pick bug from issues list
- Fix in production repo
- Test the fix
- Commit with clear message
- Repeat

**Timeline:** Flexible, no pressure

**Tracking:** Update STATUS.md after each fix

---

### 📋 Phase 4: Production Hardening (NOT STARTED)

**Goal:** Add production features gradually

**Planned Additions:**
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Integration tests for critical paths
- [ ] Basic CI/CD (run tests on commit)
- [ ] Monitoring endpoints (Prometheus-ready)
- [ ] Structured logging
- [ ] Error handling improvements
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] (Later) Authentication
- [ ] (Later) Rate limiting
- [ ] (Later) Advanced monitoring

**Timeline:** Add features as needed, not all at once

---

### 📋 Phase 5: Documentation (ONGOING)

**Goal:** Document as system stabilizes

**Planned Docs:**
- [ ] TESTING.md (after bugs fixed)
- [ ] DEPLOYMENT.md (when deployment works)
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md (when structure stable)
- [ ] HANDOFF.md (when ready for team)
- [ ] API_GUIDE.md (once API is validated)

**Approach:** Document what works, not what's broken

---

### 📋 Phase 6: Eventual Handoff (FUTURE)

**Goal:** Hand off production-ready system to experienced developers

**Readiness Criteria:**
- [ ] All critical bugs fixed
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Deployment works reliably
- [ ] Monitoring in place
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Confident in system stability

**Timeline:** TBD (could be 1-6 months)

## 🐛 Known Issues

### ⛔ CRITICAL BLOCKER: Insufficient Disk Space

**Issue:** Cannot start Docker containers due to disk space constraints on macOS

**Details:**
- **Disk:** 466 GB total, 423 GB used (98% capacity), only 11 GB available
- **Docker usage:** 49 GB total
  - API container: 4.61 GB (includes NVIDIA CUDA libraries)
  - Worker container: 4.66 GB (includes NVIDIA CUDA, Tesseract OCR, Poppler)
  - Frontend container: 79.8 MB
  - Base images and layers: ~40 GB
- **Required:** Minimum 30-40 GB free space needed to extract and run containers
- **Symptoms:**
  - I/O errors during container extraction: `input/output error` when writing large files (libcublas.so.12)
  - Docker daemon becomes unresponsive
  - Container creation fails mid-extraction

**Impact:**
- ❌ Cannot start services (PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, API, Worker)
- ❌ Cannot test document processing
- ❌ Cannot verify system functionality
- ✅ Containers successfully built (images exist)
- ✅ Code pushed to GitHub

**Attempted Solutions:**
1. ✅ Freed 22 GB disk space - insufficient
2. ✅ Restarted Docker Desktop multiple times
3. ✅ Rebuilt containers with clean cache
4. ❌ Still insufficient space for container extraction

**Resolution Options:**
1. **Free more disk space** on current Mac (need 20-30 GB additional)
2. **Deploy to different machine** with adequate storage (AWS EC2, cloud VM, different Mac)
3. **Optimize containers** to reduce size (remove CUDA if GPU not needed, use lighter base images)
4. **External storage** for Docker data directory (may impact performance)

**Recommendation:** Deploy to cloud instance or Mac with >100 GB free space for reliable operation

**Status:** BLOCKING Phase 2 testing

## 📞 Questions / Blockers

### ⛔ ACTIVE BLOCKER

**Disk Space Constraint**
- Current Mac has only 11 GB free (need 30-40 GB minimum)
- Blocking all Phase 2 testing and service validation
- See "Critical Blocker" section above for full details

**Next Steps to Unblock:**
1. Either: Free 20-30 GB additional space on current Mac
2. Or: Deploy to machine with adequate storage (recommended: >100 GB free)
3. Or: Optimize container sizes (remove CUDA dependencies if GPU not needed)

**Status:** Waiting for environment with adequate disk space
