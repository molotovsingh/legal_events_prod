### 🚧 Phase 2: Testing & Bug Discovery (IN PROGRESS)

**Goal:** Understand what works and what needs fixing

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Start Docker containers (`./start.sh start`)
- [ ] Verify all services start successfully
  - [ ] PostgreSQL
  - [ ] Redis
  - [ ] MinIO
  - [ ] FastAPI API
  - [ ] Worker process
- [ ] Test with sample PDFs
  - [ ] famas_dispute/Answer to Request for Arbitration.pdf
  - [ ] amrapali_case/Amrapali Allotment Letter.pdf
- [ ] Verify extraction quality vs POC
- [ ] Test all providers
  - [ ] OpenRouter
  - [ ] Anthropic
  - [ ] OpenAI
  - [ ] LangExtract (Gemini)
- [ ] Test export functionality
  - [ ] CSV export
  - [ ] XLSX export
  - [ ] JSON export
- [ ] Document all bugs found in GitHub Issues
- [ ] Update this STATUS.md with findings

**Expected Completion:** Week 1

---

### 📋 Phase 3: Iterative Fixes (NOT STARTED)

**Goal:** Fix discovered bugs one by one

**Process:**
- Pick bug from issues list
- Fix in production repo
- Test the fix
- Commit with clear message
- Repeat

**Timeline:** Flexible, no pressure

**Tracking:** Update STATUS.md after each fix

---

### 📋 Phase 4: Production Hardening (NOT STARTED)

**Goal:** Add production features gradually

**Planned Additions:**
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Integration tests for critical paths
- [ ] Basic CI/CD (run tests on commit)
- [ ] Monitoring endpoints (Prometheus-ready)
- [ ] Structured logging
- [ ] Error handling improvements
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] (Later) Authentication
- [ ] (Later) Rate limiting
- [ ] (Later) Advanced monitoring

**Timeline:** Add features as needed, not all at once

---

### 📋 Phase 5: Documentation (ONGOING)

**Goal:** Document as system stabilizes

**Planned Docs:**
- [ ] TESTING.md (after bugs fixed)
- [ ] DEPLOYMENT.md (when deployment works)
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md (when structure stable)
- [ ] HANDOFF.md (when ready for team)
- [ ] API_GUIDE.md (once API is validated)

**Approach:** Document what works, not what's broken

---

### 📋 Phase 6: Eventual Handoff (FUTURE)

**Goal:** Hand off production-ready system to experienced developers

**Readiness Criteria:**
- [ ] All critical bugs fixed
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Deployment works reliably
- [ ] Monitoring in place
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Confident in system stability

**Timeline:** TBD (could be 1-6 months)
